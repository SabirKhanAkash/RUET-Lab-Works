abstract = "Abstract Organizations share data about individuals to drive business and comply with law and regulation. However, an adversary may expose confidential information by tracking an individual across disparate data publications using quasi-identifying attributes (e.g., age, geocode and sex) associated with the records. Various studies have shown that well-established privacy protection models (e.g., k-anonymity and its extensions) fail to protect an individual’s privacy against this “composition attack”. This type of attack can be thwarted when organizations coordinate prior to data publication, but such a practice is not always feasible. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic model called ( d , α ) -linkable, which mitigates composition attack without coordination. The model ensures that d confidential values are associated with a quasi-identifying group with a likelihood of α . We realize this model through an efficient extension to k-anonymization and use extensive experiments to show our strategy significantly reduces the likelihood of a successful composition attack and can preserve more utility than alternative privacy models, such as differential privacy.

abstract = {The impact of laws restricting health insurers' use of genetic information has been assessed from two main vantage points: (1) whether they reduce the extent of genetic discrimination and (2) whether they reduce the fear of discrimination and the resulting deterrence to undergo genetic testing. A previous report from this study concluded that there are almost no well-documented cases of health insurers either asking for or using presymptomatic genetic test results in their underwriting decisions, either before or after these laws, or in states with or without these laws. This report evaluates the perceptions and the resulting behavior by patients and clinicians.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Interleukin (IL)-12 is an important cytokine for innate and adaptive immunity. We previously reported that IL-12 inhibits tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$-mediated osteoclast formation by inducing apoptosis. We also reported that TNF-$\alpha$ plays an important role in mechanical loading-induced osteoclast formation and bone resorption during orthodontic tooth movement. In this study, we investigated the effects of IL-12 on mechanical tooth movement in mice. DESIGN: A Ni-Ti closed coil spring was inserted between the upper incisors and the upper left first molar in mice. IL-12 was injected locally adjacent to the first molar every other day during the experimental period, at doses varying from 0 to 1.5$\mu$g/day. After 12 days, the animals were killed and their jaws were processed for histological evaluation using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labelling (TUNEL) staining, and measurements of the root resorption area. RESULTS: In the IL-12-treated mice, tooth movement and root resorption appeared to be reduced. In TUNEL-stained sections, many apoptotic cells were recognized on the pressure side in the IL-12-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that IL-12 inhibits not only mechanical tooth movement, but also root resorption during orthodontic tooth movement. These findings may arise through apoptosis induced by IL-12.},
