		\begin{abstract}
			A good abstract should answer the following few
			questions. Question-1 what is the general topic of the article,
			Question-2 what is the specific topic, Question-3 what is the
			research problem, Question-4 what is the current status of the
			problem and finally Question-5 what is the contribution(s) of the
			article and/or work.

	\section{Introduction}
	\label{sec:introduction}
	This section is used to give little background and motivation
	why to write this paper/article. More specifically a detail
	answer of the questions from the abstract section
	\section{METHODOLOGY}
	To provide a framework/taxonomy to define the scope and
	methodology, technical notations that you are going to use.
	
	\section{MAIN BODY}
	To list, describe and compare the leading work in the areas
	using the uniform survey method/style that your have defined
	in the above section. This section may contain some definition
	like as follows:\\
	\textsc{Definition 1 (Composition anonymity):}\textit{For an individual i,
		the composition anonymity offered by n independent k-
		anonymized data sets is equal to the number of distinct
		common sensitive values of the equivalence classes in which
		the individualâ€™s record resides.}\\

	$\ast$Dr. Trovato insisted his name be rst.\\
	$\dagger$The secretary disavows any knowledge of this author's ac-
	tions.\\
	$\ddagger$This author is the one who did all the really hard work.
	\subsection{Part-1}
	The numbers of sections and subsections are subject to your topic. This section may contain some equations like follows:
	
	\begin{align}
	P(\hat{t}) &= P(\hat{q_1})\times P(\hat{q_{2}})\times ...\times P(\hat{q_{m}})\times P(s) \nonumber \\
	&= (\prod_{i=1}^{m} P(\hat{q_{i}}))\times P(s)
	\end{align}
	
	\subsection{Part-2}
	In end of each section and end of this paper, it is always a
	good ideas to summarize your work by listing the technologies/
	methods that you have discussed and compare them using
	a table or figure.

	\section{REFERENCE TEST}
	Referencing is one of the important parts of article writ-
	ing. Let's list some reference articles. This is\cite{Blum2005} a good
	conference paper. But, I like to read journal like\cite{Samarati:2001:PRI:627337.628183}. It is
	not a bad idea to read technical report like \cite{Li2011}.
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	\label{Conclusion}
	Again summarize you work to show that you have suc-
	cessfully achieved your objectives.
